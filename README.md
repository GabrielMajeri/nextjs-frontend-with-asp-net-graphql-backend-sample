# Next.js + ASP.NET + GraphQL API sample project

## Description

This repository contains a sample project combining a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) front end
with an [ASP.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet) back end,
using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) at the API layer.
It aims to remain as simple and unencumbered as possible, while still following as many best practices as possible.

## Setup

You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed in order to develop the front end.
You need the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download), version 8, for the back end.

You will have to manually start the [front end web app](frontend) and the [back end API server](backend).
See the READMEs in each of the respective directories for detailed instructions.

For production deployments, we recommend using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (or any other containerization solution).
